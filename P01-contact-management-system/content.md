Applying for jobs consists of a lot of moving parts. Between keeping track of connections, names, emails, status of your application, interview dates, what connections you have at various places, what offers you have out, it can easily turn into a situation like this:

So let's try to avoid that!

# Job Offer Steps to Success

For this chapter, we're going to be using the [Job Offer Steps to Success](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18T7xSIWxxOkWbGImLqHiOflepw2S6h-cM-1y4l9zrjQ/edit?usp=sharing) tool. This tool includes a contact management system, a network builder, an application tracker, networking goals sheet, and a job offer calculator! We'll go over each of these parts in the next sections

# Networking Goals

This is an important first step, as it's something you can take immediate action on today! It's also going to be key in terms of unlocking referrals for you, and for expanding your connections! **Remember, 80% of job offers happen through referrals, so it's important to start building your network now so that you have more people who can refer you down the road!**

>
> Write out your networking goals for the next 2 terms. Use the example provided as a guide.

Make sure to take time at the end of each term to check in and see if you met your goals. Also use that time to plan goals for future terms!

# Contacts

Use this tab to keep track of contacts you make or are planning on making during each term! Here's a brief overview of each column:

- **Contact:** Name of contact
- **Current Status:** Their company/role, how you met them, and contact information
- **Last communication:** date of last communication with this contact, as well as a high-level overview of what was discussed.
- **Next Steps:** What your next steps are in terms of contacting this person, or action items you need to complete based on the last conversation you had.

> [action]
>
> Fill in any contacts you've made so far, and add ones that you want to reach out to. Feel free to make a new section titled "Junior Year" to put any contacts you made during your first year at Make School

Every time you make a new contact, fill out their info in this table!

# Your Network

This is more for visualizing your network. As you add contacts and establish connections with them, you can add them to your network here, and start seeing how everyone is connected! Maybe you'll find your contacts know each other!

> Fill out the Your Network tab with your existing contacts. Add more as you make them!


# Applications

**This tab is ESSENTIAL when you start sending in job applications!** Filling it out will help you keep track of which companies you're interviewing with, which ones you still need to apply for, where your status is with each company, and more. It's a way to manage all the moving parts instead of trying to keep it all in emails and your head. Here you can get a view of everything and see what needs your attention next.

> If you've already started your job application process, fill this out now with all the places you've actively interviewing at, places you've applied, places you're going to apply, and ones where you are no longer pursuing.

# Job Offer Calculator

Think of this as your epiphany moment, the great realization:

![epiphany](./assets/epiphany.gif)

This calculator will give you an _estimate_ (one more time, _ESTIMATE_) on how many job offers you can expect to get based on the following:

- How many LinkedIn requests to connect you send
- How many job applications you submit
- how many _meaningful_ contacts you've made

The first two are self-explanatory, but what is a "meaningful" contact?

Think of your contacts. Of them, who matches the following description:

- You've talked to them at least twice (ideally more)
- They have a solid understanding of what you're looking for in your career
- You believe they would be comfortable giving you a referral.

Think of the people in your network who fit the above description, and those are your "meaningful" contacts

> Fill out the yellow boxes in the Job Offer Calculator. Use your current number of LinkedIn connections, current number of applications submitted, and current number of meaningful contacts to start.

Though the number of expected job offers may be small at this moment in time, it is _NOT_ representative of where you will be in the future. Use this as a learning experience to see how many more applications and connections you need to make!

> If you obtain a high score on the job readiness rubric, please use the calculator under the `(Job Offer Calculator - if High Job Ready Score)` tab

> Start playing around with numbers on the job offer calculator and see what it would take to get at least 2 offers. That should be your goal going forward.

# Next steps

Revisit this tool and update it as you go through your job search. It's going to be vital to keeping you accountable and on track to getting that job!

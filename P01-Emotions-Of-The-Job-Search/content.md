Does this describe you?

- This is your first “real” job search.
- You’ve looked for 2-5 jobs in your life.
- Getting a job really really matters to your well-being, (purpose, finances, community)
    - Opportunity to practice your values
    - Opportunity to engage in your passion
    - A place for you to grow yourself intellectually, socially, emotionally

We’re going to talk about how to point yourself in the direction of growth, and how the process can help build your resilience!

# What is internship and job ready?

There’s 4 aspects to being job-ready:

1. **Mentally**: Technical skills, professional etiquette, advanced communication, WERK
1. **Emotionally**: Asking for help, building your confidence, clapping back at your inner critic
1. **Physically**: Taking care of your health (fitness, nutrition, screen time)
1. **Spiritually**: aligning your values with your job; serving a greater good


We’re going to spend time here focusing on the emotional side, as the job search can be an emotionally tolling process.

> [action]
>
> As fast as you can, write down all the thoughts and feelings you have about the job search.
>
> Now, what are you feeling confident about as you search for a job? Your resourcefulness, your technical skills, your work ethic, your excitement to get out of school?

Some popular questions people generally ask themselves:

- Am I ready to get the job?
- Why are other people getting jobs and not me?
- Why am I getting interviews and no job offers?
- I’ve never been hired as a software engineer… will it happen for me?
- Have I learned enough CS technical fundamentals?
- Do I have to become a software engineer?

It’s perfectly normal to have these kinds of questions. But also, remember to think about a lot of the positives that you have in your life right now, or the positives that’ll happen once you get that job:

- “I’m doing better than I think academically.”
- “I can’t wait to be financially stable / independent.”
- “I think my work is really going to impact other people.”
- “I might be a software engineer now so that I can be an artist later in life.”

You are wise! Bringing in balanced perspectives is a part of managing your job search stress. Bring it home with some visioning practice:

> [action]
>
> Imagine yourself gainfully employed by the end of your time at Make School. You’re doing work that matters to you, you’re growing your skills, you have enough money to take care of yourself, one morning in your first week it hits you - you made it.
>
> Write down answers to the following as you envision this scenario:
>
> - How did you get to this place?
> - What were you most proud of?
> - Who can you thank for helping you?
>
> Write down and reflect on the following:
>
> - What images, feelings, thoughts, stood out to you?
> - What do you need to
> - What, if anything, might get in the way of your success? What are the warning signs and who can you ask for help?

# Situate yourself, Know Yourself - Values

Identity: Depending on how old you are, your culture, your life events - we’re all at different phases of life. For many of us, we’re beginning or are in the middle of a fun process that psychologists call “individuating”, which basically means becoming your own person. This usually happens around 18-40. Some say it never ends. In this process we are:

- Defining how we are different from our family or friends
- Learning that we might like ourselves in spite of, or because of these differences
- Becoming clearer about how our unique gifts can be in service to others

Even in the healthiest forms, this process can elicit feelings of isolation, excitement, freedom, fear.

Because it’s so important to know what you really want in life (because that’s the stuff you’ll really go after), we’re going to spend some time thinking about how your values (what you currently think is the most important) are similar or different from your environments. Having this kind of self-awareness can help us know when we’re making decisions based on what we “should” do versus what we actually want.

> What are your top 3-5 values? Write these down and reference them for when you’re looking into companies you want to work for. Do these companies embody these values?

# Identify your inner critic

Inner Critic: Buddhist scholars and therapy practitioners call these states of mind habit patterns or mental formations. Depending on the type of psychology one studies or practices, they might be called schemas, archetypes, sub-personalities, or ego states. Perhaps they represent an ongoing interaction between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex.

How we think about ourselves influences our behavior, and also our inner critic. The inner critic is going to be the first (and likely primary) voice telling us we can’t do something. When we’re in the job search, the inner critic tends to rear its ugly head and fill us with negative thoughts, putting us down and making us feel less than.  We can get ahead of this by learning to work with our inner critic. Try the following to increase your emotional resiliency:

## Working with your critic

> [action]
>
> **Choose 1: ACT / WRITE / DRAW**
>
> Personify them: Give the critic a name. What do they look like? Sound like? What kind of character are they? What makes them tick?
>
> Write in their voice: What do they think of your work? What do they want for you? What are they afraid of?
>
> In your own voice: What do you want from the critic? What would you most like to hear from them?

## Tactics to Outwit the Inner Critic

**Talking about yourself in the 3rd person**

“Lauren was really surprised by that interview question so she was unsure how to answer. This isn’t a reflection of how smart she is, and now she knows how to prepare next time.”

**Self-Affirmation**

“Lauren may have made a mistake, but it doesn’t define her! She’s brave and knows how to pick herself back up.”  

# Dealing with rejection

Since we’re alive, we will experience rejection. You most likely will experience significantly more rejections than offers in the job search, and that is the reality for the majority of individuals, so rest assured you’re not alone!

> [action]
>
> Can you think of someone you really admire who has experienced rejection?

Here are a few you may be familiar with:

- Oprah
- JK Rowling
- Michael Jordan

> [action]
>
> Think about a time you were rejected. What did you learn about rejection? Write down these findings

Rejection is difficult to deal with. It's important to keep the following in mind every time you go through rejection:

- This isn’t a reflection of who you are as a person,
- Ask for feedback - be vulnerable - be humble - never hurts to ask “what could I have done differently as I move forward in the job search?”
- Ask for help
- Ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions

> [action]
>
> Write down advice to your future self who has been recently rejected. What wise words and practical advice do they need to hear?
>
> Write down advice to your future self who has received great success. What wise words and practical advice do they need to hear?
>
> How do you think you might grow over the course of the job search?

# Self-Care Routine

It's important to have a form of self-care that you practice. In addition to helping ground you on a daily basis, you can take pieces of it and do them individually if they help with working through the feelings of rejection.

Below are some suggestions of what to do. Whether you're a morning person or a night-owl, try some of these out in your self-care routine:

- Physical practices: run, yoga, cycle
- Choose healthier meal options
- Keep your phone out of sight for the first/last 30 min of your day
- Meditate or journal
- Create a schedule for your day with breaks

> [action]
>
> Create a 20 min self-care routine from this list of ideas, or ones of your own

# Review and Next Steps

Dealing with all of this in the job search process (and beyond) will be something you'll always be working on. It takes a long time of consistent practice to master working with your inner critic and creating a self-care routine that works best for you. As you go through your job search process, remember the following:

- Continue to name your hopes and fears. (Write or talk about them)
- Keep your top 5 values visible. They’re your steering wheel.
- Celebrate your rejections along with every time you ask for help or feedback!
- Create a self-care routine that honors your life on this planet
- Do something other than job searching to give you perspective

Don't lose sight of these as you go through this process. Now, let's get into the next phase of the job search prep!

# Quick Pro-Tip

A lot of this can seem daunting, especially when you're reading your 50th job posting.

To help with this, **spend no more than 30 seconds on evaluating if you should add the job to your list of potential companies**. This might sound short, but just evaluate if you match **70% of the requirements**. Don’t be too picky. We’ll go wide with potential roles then narrow down later.

# Additional Resources

If you need another source, we got one more for you!

# Apply what you've learned!

Now that you're armed with the knowledge, let's apply our learnings and find some roles!

> Based on your must-haves and nice-to-haves, use the skills you just learned to find the following roles:
>
> - 20 "match" roles
> - 10 "fallback" roles
> - 10 "reach" roles

> Remember to add these jobs to the [Applications tab in the Contact Management Tool!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18T7xSIWxxOkWbGImLqHiOflepw2S6h-cM-1y4l9zrjQ/edit#gid=1184999698)  

## Filtering further

When you're ready to narrow down, many of these platforms allow you to utilize their filters to niche down into what you're looking for. Some also may even have alerts you can set up so you're notified whenever a new job gets posted that matches what you're looking for!

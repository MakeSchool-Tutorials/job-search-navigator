Rather than using that, please utilize the [Contact Management Tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18T7xSIWxxOkWbGImLqHiOflepw2S6h-cM-1y4l9zrjQ/edit#gid=1184999698) from chapter 2 to fill in the information you find!

What's the difference between a warm connection and a cold connection?

### Scenario:

Asking for a referral, information about how to prep for an interview, industry knowledge, etc.:

### Cold Connection

### Warm Connection

**In other words, having a stronger connection with someone at a company you want to work for will unlock a lot more doors than cold-calling people on LinkedIn!**

But connections rarely start out warm, so how do we change them from cold to warm?

# See who you know

The first step is to see if you already know someone at the companies you're looking at (1st degree connection). And if you don't, do you know someone who knows people at this company (2nd degree connection)? Most connections start out cold, but the goal is to transition them from cold to warm by reaching out and gettin to know them!

## Leverage Other Social Networks

Don't feel limited by LinkedIn and other job search platforms. In fact, sometimes you can get a stronger connection by reaching out through other channels, such as social media!

**That's ok!!** It's totally understandable to be nervous, anxious, or worried. You also may feel good, and ready to just do the thing! Either way, if you've been following this guide so far,  you've been doing all you can prior to the interview to prep accordingly. Here we'll outline a few tips and strategies to follow for the night before and day of the interview!

# The Night Before

## Research The Company

You want to know all the latest news of the company to show you have vested interest in working with them. Check the company website, read their blog, google them for any news articles, find some key points. You want to be able to congratulate people if they recently launched a product, or express you interest in working on X product, etc. It shows you are interested in the company beyond just a paycheck, and can showcase a passion for working at the company.

> Spend some time researching the company you're interviewing for and come up with at least 2-3 talking points.

# Research Your Interviewer(s)

If you have the name(s) of your interviewer(s), go find them on LinkedIn! Try to get at least the following info:

- How long they've been at the company, and their title
- The last company they worked at, or if they worked at a company of significance to you (i.e. another company you may be interviewing at). This is a great chance to ask them why they like [current company] better than [former company]
- Any commonalities you may have with them (where you grew up, languages you know, skills, certifications, etc.)

Your interviewer(s) have been looking at your LinkedIn to get a better sense of you, you should do the same for them! This also allows you to connect with them on a more personal level, which could give you an advantage during the interview!

## Prep Your Questions

Every interview always concludes with the "do you have any questions?" question. You _always_ want to have questions to ask!

Luckily, if you've done the previous steps above, you've got a few great questions ready to go! If you need some help building out some more, here are a few questions from [Jessica Barnett](https://medium.com/@redheadjessica/questions-you-must-ask-your-interviewers-in-a-product-manager-interview-709faf3bd400#.622t9f7xc) that work regardless of company:

1. **What is the last thing you shipped?** You'll learn a lot about about the company's culture from this in terms of what they get done. Most importantly, you'll get to see if this is an environment where you’ll be able to get things done
1. **If you had an idea for something you thought would be great to work on, what would it take to make it happen? What is the process from having an idea to getting it out the door?** Somewhere you can never execute on your own ideas wouldn’t be much fun to work at in the long-term.
1. **What is the biggest challenge facing the business right now? What worries you? And how are you working on solving it?** You'll learn if they're going to be realistic and honest with you (no company has no challenges). You'll also get to see their attitude towards challenges: are they hopeful, or dreadful? Will also give you some insight into the problems you'll be thinking about should you join.

If you are interviewing with multiple people, it's also perfectly fine to ask them the same questions, or a sub-set of the same questions! In fact, it's in your best interest to do so to see how people answer them: do they give the same answers, or different?

> Come up with questions to ask your interviewer(s)! Feel free to use the 3 above in addition to your own.

## Get a Notebook

Get a physical notebook and pen, and write down notes in it during your interview, and when the interviewer answers your questions. The purpose of this is twofold:

1. It gives you a reference for later. It also allows you to write down interview questions for you to practice later
1. It shows you're taking this seriously to the interviewer, and that you came prepared.

Little things like this matter. Not on their own, but added up together, they lead to big impressions.

## Interview Practice problems

Do a few technical and behavioral interview problems for some practice. Practice ones you anticipate the company asking you. You can get a sense of this through researching on online through sites like Glassdoor, or by googling "[company name] technical interview questions". Don't hesitate to reach out to your peers as well who may have interviewed with this company previously. Learn from each other!

While it is good to practice, don't do this at the expense of your self-care. You could do 100s of problems the night before, but if you show up to the interview after getting crap sleep, eyes heavy, fueled solely by coffee, you won't be as sharp, and you're more likely to make a mistake.

**Don't sacrifice a good night's sleep!** A well-rested brain can handle interview problems way better than a sleep-deprived one.

## Get Enough Sleep

Seriously. You _will_ interview better if you're well rested.

7-8 hours. Just do it.

## Breathe

You've been preparing for this. You've got this. Worst case, it's a great learning experience that will prep you for the next one. Best case, you get a job. Either way, you're gaining something from it, so take some breaths, and get after it!

# The Day Of

Alright, you got a good night's sleep, and the day has finally come! Let's go over a final checklist:

## Hygiene

Whether the interview is in-person, over a video call, or even just on the phone, you want to feel good for the part. Take a shower, brush your teeth, put on deodorant, all that good stuff. Even if you won't physically be around people, it's about making yourself feel better and prep for the part. It'll put you in a much better mindset!

> [action]
>
> Practice good hygiene!

## Dress The Part

You're interviewing in tech, so a suit is not required, but you also don't want to be in your PJs. Wear something you would wear in a professional setting. Again like the hygiene above, even if they can't see you, it's more about prepping for the job you want, so take a few extra minutes to figure out what you're going to wear!

## Get Your Notebook

Make sure you have it! You should've gotten it the night before!

## Review

Just to keep things fresh in your head, do a light review of the research work you did the night before.

> Do a _light_ review of:

> - The company
> - Your interviewer(s) background
> - Your questions that you want to ask

## Do 1-2 Easy-Medium Interview Practice Problems

When you exercise, you warm-up first to prime your muscles and not shock your system. Same concept applies here: do 1-2 easy/medium interview problems to get your mind in the right headspace and ready to tackle these kinds of questions.

**Do NOT let this consume you!** This is not the time to cram, you're just warming up for the interview. Don't stress yourself out here.

> [action]
>
> Do 1-2 technical interview practice problems. These should be easy/medium difficulty relative to you

## Breathe

Seriously. Take 3 deep breaths. It's ok to have _some_ nerves before the interview, that's perfectly normal. We just don't want the nerves to consume you.

If you've been following this tutorial, working with the outcomes/student experience teams, your coach, and have been doing practice problem prep, then you are prepared for this interview. Remember, regardless of the outcome, you're going to be better for it one way or the other.

So take those 3 deep breaths and head on into your interview.

You Got This.

# Post-Interview

You've done it!! Congrats!! At this point, you can revisit any of the previous chapters to prep for other interviews as needed. Once you have an offer, check out the next chapter on salary negotiation to finish strong!

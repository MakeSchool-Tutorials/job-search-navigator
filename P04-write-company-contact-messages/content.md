Time to start crafting your messages for your contacts!

Keep in mind the context that you're sending these messages: these are people you probably don't know well (if at all), and you don't want to start off by asking for a referral. They don't even know you yet!

Think of these first meetings as informational interviews: you're just trying to learn more about them and the company. Don't come in hot out the gate asking for a referral, you need to build a relationship and some report first!

# How to Craft your Messages

Let's start off on a good note!

# Current Warm Connections

What if you already have some warm connections, and you're ready to ask them for something beyond an initial chat? We've got some templates for that as well!

# Send your messages!

Make sure you re-read them before sending to check for spelling, grammar, and rephrasing you want to do before sending your messages!

> If you haven't yet, download the [Grammarly Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en), which automatically checks spelling and grammar for you on any textfield (including emails) that you write into on a chrome tab!

Once you're comfortable with your messages, it's time to send them out!

> Send out those messages to your contacts! Make sure to add any updates to your Contact Management Tool!

Great work! You're almost there! At this point you should establish your warm connections. Once that's done, move onto the next chapter where you'll begin the job application process!

Beyond the knowing your data structures, algorithms, and how to answer [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz), the interview process has a whole other layer to it that doesn't require technical knowledge at all. An interview process is made of two main components: technical interviewing, and behavioral interviewing.

# Behavioral Interviewing

**Behavioral interviewing** is a standardized method designed to elicit information from a job candidate about relevant past behavior and performance. It is based on the premise that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.

Put more simply, **the point of these interviews is to see if you're someone that the team would enjoy working with.** The interviewers are trying to answer questions like the following:

- Are you a team-player?
- How do you respond to stress?
- How do you communicate with others?
- Are you someone who can work well with your manager?
- How well do you align with the company's mission?
- etc.

The above are just a small sample of the kinds of questions the interviewers are trying to answer by conducting behavioral interviews. Lucky for you, most of the questions are similar from company to company, so you can prep for these in advanced.

# What They CAN'T Ask You

Before we dive into what you should prep for, it's important to know what interviewers can _NOT_ ask you, as it would be illegal for them to do so.

It is illegal for an employer to ask you certain questions, such as:

- Family status / marital status / pregnancy
- Racial background or country of origin
- Religious affiliation
- Age (except when related to job eligibility)

> For more information on illegal questions, check out [this resource](https://www.betterteam.com/downloads/illegal-interview-questions-download-20170824.pdf?mtime=20170824114528)

**If you're ever asked these questions, this should be a red flag, and it would be advised to not pursue employment with this company**

## What YOU Should Never Say/Do In An Interview

A few quick Pro-Tips of what _not_ to do in an interview:

- Provide Personal info (age, marital status, etc)
- Take more than 2 minutes to answer a question
- Talk poorly about a previous company or boss
- Lie
- Not have questions for the interviewer
- Look at your phone
- Accept an offer on the spot OR when you get it via phone call

Alright, PSA is out of the way, let's dive into how to prep for this:

# Behavioral Interviewing Categories

Questions will generally fall into the following categories:

- Failures/Weaknesses
- Leadership
- Teamwork
- Pressure
- Strengths and Achievements

There are also logistical questions (salary requirements, start date, relocation, etc.), but we're giong to spend the time here discussing the above categories.

> [info]

> Note these aren't _all_ possible categories you may encounter, but aims to cover a majority of them.

# STAR Method - Behavioral Interview Strategies

Luckily for all of these categories, we can apply the same strategy!

The **STAR method** stands for the following:

- **S**ituation: Describe the event or situation that you were in
- **T**ask: Explain the task you had to complete
- **A**ction: Describe the specific actions you took to complete the task
- **R**esult: Close with the result of your efforts

You also want to make sure to **follow up** at the end of the question where you describe **what you learned** from the event.

For each question you get asked, use this method to describe an event that matches the question. Here's an example:

## Example Question

**Have you assumed a leadership role before?**

- **S** - Developer in a team gone for 3 weeks.
- **T** - Reassign tasks to meet deadline.
- **A** - Meeting with the team to inform of changes in tasks/plans
- **R** - Almost everyone agreed to the change. Project was released on time.
- **Follow up:** What I learned...

## Why Should I Bullet-Point My Answers?

While it's tempting to write out a full script to answer these questions, in reality, it will be too hard to memorize a script for all of the questions you may prep for. It will also _sound_ scripted to the interviewer if you are just reading off of a prompt...cause you are!

If you write out these bullet point answers instead, it comes with a few more benefits:

- easier to memorize (less to remember)
- Having to fill in the event/story yourself will make it more authentic
- The bullets act as an outline, or a guide to the story, and you just need to follow it.

Alright so we have our strategy, let's put it into practice!

> First create a new document called Behavioral Interview Questions - This is where you'll put all the questions/answers that you write. You will use this to prep for interviews and as a personal resource for the interview process! Any new question you encounter, add it to the doc!

# Failures/Weaknesses

This is a popular one for a reason. **The goal here is to show that you know how to admit your own faults, and what you're working on to improve them**. Nobody is perfect, so avoid saying you have no weaknesses/failures, or a "strength" like being a perfectionist. Give real answers, and use the STAR method!

> Using the STAR method, craft answers to the following questions:
>
> 1. What is your most significant weakness?
> 1. Describe a time when, despite your best efforts, you failed at something.
> 1. Tell me about a time you couldn't meet a deadline.

# Leadership

Even when you're starting out, employers still want to gauge your leadership potential. Leadership doesn't necessarily mean you led a project/team though: it can measure other qualities as well, such as knowing how to deal with a difficult coworker, or how you responded when someone challenged your decision, or how you were able to persuade people. Even if you haven't had an explicit leadership role, you should be able to respond to most of these types of questions. If no examples come up related to tech or Make School, thank back to other times in your life that could work as well!

> 1. Describe a time when your leadership made a difference.
> 1. Describe a situation when you had to provide negative feedback to a team member or co-worker.
> 1. Describe a time when your leadership was challenged. How did you respond to it?
> 1. Discuss a situation where you had to persuade someone to agree with your point of view.

# Teamwork

People want to know that they can work with you. They want to see if you're going to be easy to work with, and that you'll support the team.

> Using the STAR method, craft answers to the following questions:
>
> 1. Describe a time when you worked on a dysfunctional team. What did you do to get the team on track to reach its goal?
> 1. Describe a time when you had a conflict with a team member. How did you resolve it?
> 1. Describe a situation where you played a key role in helping your team succeed.

# Pressure

How you handle stress/pressure is critical to how you perform on the job. You will most likely experience fast deadlines and crunch in your career, and your employer is going to want to know how you handle it:

> 1. Describe a time when you were under a great deal of stress to meet several deadlines. How did you handle it?
> 1. Describe how you deal with unexpected events on the job.
> 1. How do you prioritize projects and tasks when scheduling your time?  Give me some examples.


# Strengths and Achievements

Lastly, you are going to want to highlight why you're the person for the job! Remember, you're trying to sell the interviewer on _you_, so come ready with some great selling points! Just make sure to work on that balance of highlighting work while not going into bragging territory.

> 1. What is your greatest achievement to date?
> 1. What are your greatest strengths?
> 1. Why should we hire you?

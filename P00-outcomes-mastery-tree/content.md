# Outcomes Mastery Tree

Above is the Make School Outcomes Mastery Tree. Think of this as your roadmap to getting that job offer by the end of your time here at Make School. Here's how to read the tree:

1. The top half of the document (above that first solid line) are items to be completed in your first year at Make School (Terms 1-5 of Junior year). Note the "*" footnotes and read them as they specify what terms the Mock Technical Interviews and Tech Interview Rubric Pass should happen.
1. Terms 1-2 of senior year have the industry collaboration project in SPD, so you'll be using that time to build your portfolio, and build your network through your industry partner
1. The bottom half of the tree show the steps that need to be taken in Terms 3-5 of Senior year in order to secure a job by graduation.
1. Lastly, don't feel limited by this tree. If you happen to move ahead, and complete steps ahead of time, that's fantastic! But if not, no worries at all, as long as you keep in line with the timeline as given  by this tree.

# Company and Role Fit Rubric: Finding Your Match

It's time to start thinking about what kind of role would best suit you! There's lots of different engineering roles out there, at lots of different types of companies! There's also no right answer to this. While skill-level definitely plays a role, your decision is also going to be based a lot on personal preference. Some people prefer a smaller company over a bigger one, or vice versa. Both are absolutely fine!

What's _not_ fine is not knowing your path, so we're here to help you with that!

> [Create a copy of this rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bnvGp0CM30y-N3K463zg3lGXSt3q8mWoASCko0x1uKk/edit) using File --> Make a Copy. From there, begin filling it out to find your Match, Reach, and Fallback roles, and then name at least 3 companies that would fall into each of those roles.

If you have questions around this, or need help filling it out, talk to your SPD instructor or coach!

Congrats! You’ve received a job offer, and you must be super excited!

While many people think this is it, you've still got some work left to do. You want to make sure your offer is fair, and that you're getting what you're worth. Use this chapter to prepare for your salary negotiation!

# But Should I Negotiate My Salary?

**You should always negotiate your salary.** This is normal in Silicon Valley. Employers expect it. A little negotiation work can make you a lot of money (ex. 2 hours of negotiation = thousands of dollars earned).

## Common concerns

### Am I burdening the company financially?

**Absolutely Not.** A few thousand dollars is a very small amount relative to a company’s budget.

### If I ask for more $, they will expect more from me and judge me harder

**Asking for more money does not lead to higher expectations.** Employer happiness with employees is binary - they are either satisfied with your overall contribution or not. Once they hire you, they don’t think about if your contributions correlate to your pay. Your manager likely won’t even be aware of how much money you are making.

### I’ll hurt my relationship with my employer if we start off with an argument over salary.

It’s totally normal and okay for salary conversations to get heated. It’s a game, both people are trying to optimize their gain while respecting each other. We’ve seen dozens of negotiations get heated and then, after it resolves, people start positively at the company as if nothing happened. This is normal. However, it is not normal for companies to attack your character or ask you uncomfortable questions like “why don’t you trust me?”. If this happens it could be a sign of a toxic company culture - you may not want to work there. **Going through a salary negotiation may bring to light red flags you may not have otherwise seen until after you started!**

### The company probably isn’t open to negotiating.

Some are open. Some aren’t. **There's no harm in asking!**

### Ok, that helps, but I still have more concerns

That's understandable! Reach out to the Make School outcomes director so that they can address your concerns directly!

### Ok, I feel good now

Excellent! Let's keep going

# Parts of an Offer

Before we dive deep into the negotiation, let's make sure we have a solid base to work off of by confirming a few things about your offer.

**You have the offer in writing as a digital or physical document.** A verbal offer is _never_ official, and should not be treated as such. You should never accept an offer verbally or on the spot.

> [action]
>
> If you receive a verbal offer respond with, “I’m really excited to look this over and am excited to run this by my mentors and friends.” Talk to the Outcomes Director and Student Experience manager to make sure the terms are fair.

## Things to watch out for

- If someone's "offer" involves you doing all the work, or they refuse to tell you their idea, there's a clear lack of trust and fairness, and should be avoided
- If the position doesn't make sense (i.e. C-level/founder position), be wary and seek outside opinions.
- Non-enforceable provisions in contracts or Health-related questions. These cannot be asked/enforced so avoid them.

## Salary

Your offer should contain your **salary:** a fixed regular payment, typically paid on a monthly or biweekly basis but often expressed as an annual sum, made by an employer to an employee. Salary amount will always depend on the company, but you should be in the $90k+ range. This scale below shouldn't be viewed as absolute truth, but as a rough guide for estimating what a company may offer based on their size/value:

- <$60k: unusual
- $60-80k: Early seed startup
- $80-100k: Pre-Series A
- $100-120k: Market
- $120+: Above Market

Your future employer will benchmark your salary based off your previous salary. **This means most employer won’t pay you less than your previous employer. That means that a gain of a few thousands of dollars from negotiation can mean tens or hundreds of thousand more dollars over your career.**

## Equity

**Equity:** ownership of a company. This comes in the form of a stock, or any other security.

You get more equity the earlier you join a company because

1. Your contribution is more pivotal to the company’s success
1. you take on more risk because the company has less funding.

Here are roughly what the industry norms are for equity:

- 25+% - Co-Founder
- 10-25% - Unusual
- 5-10% - Executives, critical early hires
- 1-5% - Very early employees
- 0-1% - Typical

**Assume the value of your equity is $0. Most equity isn’t worth anything because few companies exit or IPO.** Be weary of companies that try to replace a fair salary with more equity. Remember, this is money you may never see (and likely will not). For every Uber or AirBnB, there are 100s if not 1000s of companies that don't have a successful exit or IPO.

> [action]
>
> If you truly think a company has a shot of getting big, ask your employer the following questions:
>
> - What’s the current valuation (or current financial worth) of the company?
> - What % of company does my share of equity represent?
> - What is the form of my equity? Are they options or shares? What’s the strike price?
> - What’s the vesting schedule?
>
> You should expect companies to share this information. If they say they can’t it may be a red flag

## Bonus

A bonus is an amount of money added to wages on a seasonal basis, especially as a reward for good performance. They're also given as a starting bonus that you get if you sign with the company as a one-time bonus. These are typically larger than a standard bonus.

Note that there may or may not be a bonus, and some bonuses come with strings attached (i.e. you don't get it unless you stay at the company for X years). **Make sure the company doesn’t give you a big bonus in lieu of a smaller salary.**

> [action]
>
> Calculate your bonus vs. salary to assess the long term financial impact.

## Everything else

The above cover the major parts of your offer. But you should still read it in its entirety. Keep the following in mind:

- **Read the documents, seriously!** You don't want to agree to something you aren't comfortable with
- Keep records of all documents. If you don’t, nothing is enforceable
- Confidentiality agreements are standard, don't let these scare you
- Invention assignment agreements are required, and standard. An invention assignment agreement is when the employer claims rights ownership of everything that the employee makes for the company.
- Non-compete agreements (where you can't work for a competitor) are NOT enforceable in California
- Employment is at will: An employee can be dismissed by an employer for any reason (that is, without having to establish "just cause" for termination), and without warning.

# Employee Vs Contractor

You may be getting an offer as an employee or a contractor. There are many differences between an employee and a contractor. Here we'll highlight the major ones:

- Employees get paid on an hourly or monthly basis, have employer-provided benefits, paid time off (PTO) and can get overtime
- Contractors are paid hourly or based on deliverables. They typically do not get benefits or PTO. They do have a lot more freedom though in terms of when they work, who they work for, etc. But sine the payment is based solely on active hours worked or deliverables, the pay will not be steady.
- There are different tax implications as well. Employees get a W-2, and contractors get a 1099. Contractors usually do not get taxes taken out of their pay, so they will have to set aside taxes themselves that they then need to pay later
    - If you're a contractor, it's wise to set aside 30% of your payment for taxes.

# Leverage Your Offer

Don’t fall in love with your first offer!

Your offers are far more appealing to other companies. **Leverage your first offer to snag one at a dream company.**

> [action]
>
> Apply to 30 new companies with a message like this:
>
> “I already have an offer in hand but I’m really passionate about your company. I only have a couple weeks. Is it possible to talk on that timeline?”

This message (politely) pressures companies to prioritize your application. **Apply to your reach companies with this!**

> [action]
>
> Message all current places where you’ve applied with something like this:
>
> “Hi [RECRUITER], I just received another offer but am really passionate about your company. I only have a couple weeks. Could we talk on that timeline?”

**This message helps you reignite interest from places where you’ve already applied**

## Exploding Offers

You may receive an **exploding offer**: one that expires at a certain date.

This is generally looked down upon in the HR world, so if you get one, contact the Student Experience manager. We may help you extend the deadline.

Ideally, you want multiple offers. As you’ll see below, you can leverage them in negotiation.


# How To Negotiate Your Offer

Alright, we got the prerequisite knowledge out of the way! Time to talk about how to negotiate your offer

![money](./assets/money.gif)

So you definitely don't want to do that (they won't just hand you money, we promise). Here's a better strategy to follow:

1. **Is your salary at market rate?**
    - Look at [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com) and [Glassdoor](Glassdoor.com) - see reported salary for your role at your company
    - Look at salary for employees in similar roles in 10 companies in your industry
    - Reference this [intern salary list](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/04/these-big-tech-companies-pay-their-interns-the-most)
    - Compare to Make School Student average salary: $90k-$100
1. **Try and get another offer.** You have more leverage in negotiation if you are choosing between options. See “Leverage Your Offer” section above for more details.
1. **Identify your BATNA (Best alternative to a negotiated offer).** This is thinking through what happens if you do not take this job. What’s your plan B? How difficult is it? Recognizing that you have other options can give you strength and confidence to negotiate. Have faith in your skills and abilities. If you don’t take this job, you’ve already proven that you are hirable.
1. **Write a draft negotiation email to your potential employer.** Work off [this template here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RNsOoKREK8S81lei84WNivZLo_VcVY1SvKEZk1Uglm0/edit). Get feedback from Megan before you send. “Given my personal situation, the salary range that I would need to make this work is …”
1. **Send email.**
